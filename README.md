# github-wiki
A wiki powered by github pages and github.js.

## Setup
1. Fork this repository.
2. [Create a github API app.](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
3. Go to [//auth-server](https://auth-server.herokuapp.com) and login with one of the options.
4. On //auth-server, add the credentials for your API app, add a useful reference, and set the domain to "${Github-Username}.github.io", replacing "${Github-Username}" with your Github username.
5. Optionally rename this repo. Unless you set a custom domain, this will be part of the URL.
6. Your URL is "${Domain}/${Repo}", where "${Domain}" is the domain from step 4, and "${Repo}" unless you changed it is "github-wiki", otherwise what you set in step 4.
7. Go there to finish the setup.
